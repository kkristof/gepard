GEPARD
=====

The Gepard aims to be a hardware accelerated 2D
rendering engine.

Aside from the main goal (that is hardware accelerated) we aim to
create an engine which is:
* lightweight: as there should be only rendering related part in the code.
* modular/configurability: provide configuration options where the developer
can specify which part is needed.
